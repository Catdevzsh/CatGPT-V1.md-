CatGPT-V1
CatGPT-V1 is an experimental project aimed at recreating the functionality of OpenAI's Codex API using Gemini. This project is inspired by the capabilities of Codex and seeks to provide a similar experience, allowing users to generate code from natural language prompts.
Please note: This project is currently in its early stages and is under active development. Functionality may be limited and subject to change.
Features
Natural Language to Code: Convert natural language instructions into working code.
Multiple Programming Languages: Support for a variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and more.
Code Completion: Provide intelligent suggestions for completing code snippets.
Code Debugging: Assist in identifying and resolving errors in code.
Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Access to Google's Gemini API.
Basic understanding of programming concepts.
Installation:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Catdevzsh/CatGPT-V1.md-.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd CatGPT-V1.md-
Configuration:
Obtain your Gemini API key and update the config.py file accordingly.
Usage:
Run the main script: python catgpt.py
Enter your natural language prompts and observe the generated code.
Examples
Input: Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number.
Output:
def factorial(n):
  """
  This function calculates the factorial of a given number.

  Args:
      n: The number for which to calculate the factorial.

  Returns:
      The factorial of n.
  """
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
Use code with caution.
Python
Limitations
Accuracy: As an experimental project, the accuracy of the generated code may vary.
Functionality: Not all features of Codex are currently implemented.
Gemini API Access: Access to the Gemini API is required for this project.
